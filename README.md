# SushiRoyal website!

SushiRoyal website, for the Sushi lovers. This website was created with Vanilla JavaScript using modules and DOM manipulation. I start with an almost blank HTML file and build every element displayed using JS. We used Webpack 4 to bundle all the different files and modules together to display the website.
